    <p id="ParagraphOne">Hi, I'm Claire ! I have over 15 years experience in Accounting and Business Support Services. I 
        am an ambitious, motivated, get it done! person. I enjoy new challenges and expanding my knowledge
        and skills. While working for Old Mutual I found I was drawn to IT, and decided to steer my career
        in this direction. I have completed a Software Engineering course with
        HyperionDev, where I found I had a natural flair for both Java and SQL, and I am looking for entry level positions
        which make use of these skills.
    </p>

    <h2 style="font-family:cursive">Work Experience</h2>
    <p>I started my career as an accountant, ultimately working at Old Mutual for a nine year
        period. I have experience as a Fund Accountant on a Corporate project reconciling schemes which 
        were being migrated to a new platform in the business. As this involved large amounts of data 
        we used SQL to run queries. I also collaborated with the Lead Programmer to develop an automated
        system to assist us in our reconciliations. This project is where my passion for IT was born!
    </p>
    
    <h2 style="font-family:cursive">Education</h2>
    <p>I graduated with Honours in Accounting Science at the University of South Africa. In my
        move towards IT I have completed short courses in both Business Systems Analysis and Data 
        Analysis which have added to my abililty to analyse and present data, especially with regards
        to the modelling of systems and data flows. I will soon complete a Software Engineering
        qualification from HyperionDev, where I have honed my skills in both Java and SQL, as well
        as Python, the JDBC, Git and GitHub and Object Oriented Programming.
    </p>
    
    <h2 style="font-family:cursive">Skills and Competencies</h2>
    <p>I have proven reconciliation skills as well as the analysis of data in an Excel environment. I
        have excellent analytical skills as well as logical problem solving abilities. I 
        can program in both Python and Java, but I enjoy Java the most! I can create and update databases
        in SQL and also use the JDBC to interface with SQL and run commands from Java. I have a high
        productivity level, I learn quickly and work easily in a team environment.
